# Ngrx
State management in Angular

## Project setup
Use Node v18.12.0

Use NVM to switch node versions.
```
nvm list
nvm install 18.12.0
nvm use 18.12.0
```

Starting the project:

```
npm install
cd server  
npm run server (backend server)

To start UI:
npm start  (on root directory)
http://localhost:4200
```

See proxy.json, and url call of type /api/ gets routed to our backend server running in localhost on port 9000.

## Concepts

As a pre-requisite to using ngrx, go yhrough the rxjs repo, as ngrx sate is based on reactive programming.
